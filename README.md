# Distributed Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)
Blockchain-based PKI enhancement

In this project we will demonstrate a prototype of how Decentralized Public Key Infras-tructure (DPKI) and its security features would look like.  DPKI as an idea took shape atone of the Reboot Web of Trusts workshops in 2015.  In today’s Internet,  there is a hugesecurity risk by having identities (email addresses, domain names, usernames etc.)  storedin  centralized  systems  such  as  Certificate  Authorities,  Domain  Name  System  servers  etc.Through  DPKI,  the  idea  is  to  return  the  ownership  of  the  identity  to  the  users  who  areusing  it.   It  achieves  this  using  decentralization  (blockchain)  technology.   This  allows  for “permissionless bootstrapping” of identity and has significant security enhancements whencompared to PKI. For this project, our prototype will include a basic network that needs tocommunicate over a custom SSL channel (we call it SSL Lite) which uses DPKI instead ofPKI. Within the scope of this project, we will also outline any challenges/limitations thatwe come across that could prevent this technology from being widely adopted.
